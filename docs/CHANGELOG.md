# Changelog

Each entry is numbered with a monotonically increasing integer. Append new entries to the end. Never reuse or reorder numbers. Numbers are globally unique across this file and any future `CHANGELOG-archive.md` — never reused. Write each entry as durable project memory: what is now true that wasn't before, plus the why in a clause when not obvious — not a recap of the diff (filenames and mechanical edits live there). Keep it to 1–5 lines, ~20 words per line at most; never one packed run-on line.

1. Established the anchoring docs and CLAUDE.md scaffolding for the cat-door vision prototype:
   CONCEPT (why/what), ARCHITECTURE (how — thin Pi edge streaming MJPEG to an NVIDIA compute PC),
   and root + edge/compute/shared CLAUDE.md.
   Framed as an early prototype on a trusted LAN: no auth between components, and door actuation
   plus its access-decision policy are deferred to a later phase.
