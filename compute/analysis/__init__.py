"""The analysis package: the offline-oracle registry the API and runner resolve through.

The compute tier validates the edge's live MOG2 motion gate by running a stronger,
slower oracle over already-stored frames *offline* and recording a per-frame verdict
(see the motion-gate-oracles spec). This ``__init__`` is deliberately thin: it is the
*registry* — ``get_analyzer(name)`` maps a stable oracle id to a freshly constructed
backend — and nothing else, so importing ``compute.analysis`` drags in neither the
CV/ML stack nor even the backend modules.

Why lazy, per-name imports inside ``get_analyzer`` rather than importing the backends at
module top: the two backends carry heavy, *opt-in* dependencies (``ultralytics``/``torch``
for YOLO; a CUDA-bound deep-background-subtraction net for BSUV — installed from
``compute/requirements-analysis.txt``, not the lean collector requirements). A top-level
import would make the whole always-on collector process — which imports the store and the
ingest client, never the analyzers — fail to start whenever those extras are absent.
Importing a backend only when its oracle is actually requested keeps that cost off
everyone who never runs a sweep, and lets a missing dependency surface as an
``ImportError`` from exactly the ``get_analyzer`` call that needs it (the API layer maps
that to a 503 "install compute/requirements-analysis.txt"), while an unknown *name* is a
client mistake surfaced as ``ValueError`` (→ 400).
